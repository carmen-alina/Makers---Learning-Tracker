## Project title
Santander cycles is a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) of an "hire out a bike" scheme.

## Development process
Test Driven Development

## Programming language
Ruby

## Learning objectives

#### Challenge 1
* Set up a simple project
* Explain why a complete README is important
* Intialize and push a git project

#### Challenge 2
* Give the structure of a User Story
* Extract a Domain Model from User Stories

#### Challenge 3
* Define 'Feature Test'
* Define 'stack trace'
* Use irb to run a 'feature test'

#### Challenge 4
* Explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors
* Debug an error using a stack trace

#### Challenge 5
* Define RSpec as a testing framework
* Create a spec file
* Describe and Object using a specification
* Set up a Unit Test

#### Challenge 6
* Pass a unit test
* Use require

#### Challenge 7
* Move between Feature and Unit Tests

#### Challenge 8
* Write an RSpec test using it
* Test that an Object responds to a Message

#### Challenge 9
* Practice Learning Objectives from Challenges 3 â€“ 8

#### Challenge 10
* Use Objects within other Objects
* Use RSpec 'predicate' syntax
* Pass a feature test

#### Challenge 11
* Write RSpec tests that require arguments
* Pass an instance as an argument
* Set an attribute on an instantiated Object using an @ instance variable
* Use attr_reader to read an attribute on an instantiated Object

#### Challenge 12
* Write RSpec tests that expect errors
* Use fail or raise to raise an error
* Use a 'guard condition'

#### Challenge 13
* Write RSpec tests that expect errors
* Use fail or raise to raise an error
* Use a 'guard condition'

#### Challenge 14
* Set a complex attribute on an instantiated Object
* Set an initial attribute value using initialize

#### Challenge 15
* Use the Single Responsibility Principle
* Refactor code for readability

#### Challenge 16
* Use a constant

#### Challenge 17
* Set an initial attribute value using initialize
* Set a default initialization value

#### Challenge 18
* Implement a feature from scratch

#### Challenge 19
* Explain why doubles are needed to isolate unit tests
* Use a double to isolate a unit test

#### Challenge 20
* Explain why method stubs are needed to isolate unit tests
* Use a method stub to isolate a unit test
* Discuss 'London' and 'Chicago' testing styles

#### Challenge 21
* Implement a feature from scratch

#### Challenge 22
* Extract shared behaviour to a Module
* Test Modules
* Mix a Module into a Class using include

####  Post Challenge
* Reuse flexible code in a different domain
* Add an interactive text interface to a program
